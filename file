Continuous testing is a strategy of evaluating quality at every step of continuous delivery process.

And Continuous means undisrupted testing done on a continuous basis. In a Continuous DevOps process, a software change  is 
continuously moving from Development to Testing to Deployment.
So, In simple words CT means, the code is continuously developed, delivered, tested and deployed.

whenever a developer checks the code in the Source Code Server like Jenkins, automated set of unit tests are executed in the 
continuous process. If the tests fail, the build is rejected, and the developer is notified. If the build passes the test, 
it is deployed to performance, QA servers for exhaustive functional and load tests. The tests are run in parallel. 
If the tests pass, the software is deployed in production.


Advantages
Core functionalities of UWID will be tested in every deployment check-ins.
Testing efforts/hours are saved due to the fully automated smoke testing. 
Immediately UWID dev team will be notified and build wonâ€™t be deployed in production, If the smoke testing fails (Core functionalities are wrong).
Even in time crunch, 100% core functionalities coverage will be tested in UWID, So this will maintain quality of the application as high.
Even a small mistake will be identified and dev team will be notified in each deployment.
	i.e. Even sequence chance of web elements are identified in sprint 4
 These tests have to be run across multiple browsers, Versions, Screen resolution and test data combinations.
